## Description

This is a small set of random utilities written in Swift. I plan to add more stuff here as I move some of my general reusable classes into Swift. The idea is this collection is platform agnostic however I typically only work on iOS so whether they're good for macOS or linux would require some testing.

## Requirements

Swift 3+

## Installation

KJHUtility is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KJHUtility"
```

## TODO

* Usage examples.
* This stuff generally works but lacks the tests to prove it.
